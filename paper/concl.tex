\section{Conclusion}

Given the list of identified issues we strongly recommend that, unless all
issues can be solved, the contract feature itself is removed from C++26 and
moved to a technical specification or white paper. We see unrealistic that the
issued can be solved in the C++26 time frame. However, a TS or white paper could
give the adequate feedback to have a more consistent and baked feature for
C++29.

If we really adopt C++26 as it is, it may be a major failure. Moreover the fact
that contracts have strong safety issues and even might become a door for
supply-chain attacks are a very strong concern. They decrease the overall safety
of the language. Given the current focus on software safety that does not seem
an acceptable route.

If the committee decides to go ahead with contracts for C++26, still some issues
pointed out in this paper are worth to be solved. But that seems like a partial
and not very recommendable path.
